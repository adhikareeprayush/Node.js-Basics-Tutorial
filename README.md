# Node.js Basics Tutorial

Welcome to my Node.js learning repository! This project contains various scripts and modules that I've developed while exploring and learning about Node.js. The repository is structured into four main folders, each focusing on different aspects of Node.js.

## Table of Contents
- [Introduction](#introduction)
- [File Management](#file-management)
- [Node Globals](#node-globals)
- [Node Modules](#node-modules)
- [Getting Started](#getting-started)

## Introduction
The **Introduction** folder contains the history and evolution of Node.js, detailing its inception, growth, and significance in the JavaScript ecosystem. Here, you'll find insights into:
- **Node.js History and Evolution:** A brief overview of how Node.js has developed over the years, from its creation by Ryan Dahl in 2009 to the formation of the Node.js Foundation and its current status.

## File Management
The **File Management** folder contains scripts related to handling files and directories in Node.js. This section covers various file operations such as:
- **ask.js**
- **creating-dir.js**
- **list-dir.js**
- **reading-files.js**
- **rename-remove-dirs.js**
- **rename-remove-files.js**
- **stream.js**
- **writableStreams.js**
- **write-append.js**

Each script demonstrates different techniques for managing files and directories, providing a practical understanding of how Node.js interacts with the file system.

## Node Globals
The **Node Globals** folder includes scripts that explore Node.js global objects and functions. In this section, you'll find examples of:
- **global.js**
- **process.js**
- **reporting-progress.js**
- **setInterval.js**
- **setTimeOut.js**
- **stdin-stdout.js**

These scripts help in understanding the built-in global objects and how to use them effectively in Node.js applications.

## Node Modules
The **Node Modules** folder is focused on understanding and creating modules in Node.js. It includes:
- **collectAnswer.js**
- **checkModule.js**
- **core-modules.js**
- **create-module.js**
- **eventEmitter.js**
- **export-custom-modules.js**
- **readLine.js**

This section introduces the concept of modules, how to use core modules, and how to create and export custom modules in Node.js.

## Getting Started
To start working with the scripts in this repository:

1. **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone <your-repo-url>
    ```
2. **Navigate to the project directory:**
    ```bash
    cd <your-repo-directory>
    ```
3. **Install Node.js:**
